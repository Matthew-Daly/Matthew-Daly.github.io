Why do I want to learn software development?

Hard question. The easy answer would be that I want to make a lot of money, but that's not really true. I've never been - often, to my own detriment - too motivated by money. Though as I get older I can appreciate having more of it than less.

I know I want to make things, cool things...I'm just not really sure what they are yet. I keep on reading that I have to know the why behind my motivations in order to succeed, but how can I truly know the why until I fully understand the thing itself. 

How can I know what's possible until I really understand the potential of programming? Ask someone who is learning an instrument that question and they may look at you a bit cocked-eyed...to play music of course. The motivation is intrinsic to the endeavor. If their only motivation is to meet girls, they most likely give up in short order.

I think the same principle should apply here. I do it, to do it. To see what is going to happen. To see what skill, once acquired, and my muses will come up with (most likely a Pokemon Go ripoff, but with Giga Pets. Hey, never said my muses were any good).

On the more pragmatic side of things; I am also doing this because I want a more fulfilling work life. To be succinct; I want a profession that allows me both financial and physical mobility, and which demands creativity and the full use of my mental facilities. 

I want to see how far I can take this thing. Like a man driving a car on empty, I want to see what's on the other side of that red line. 

Oh, and I want to meet girls.
