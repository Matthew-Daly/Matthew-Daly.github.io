							                Why I decided to enroll in a Data Science Boot Camp

In Dec. 1983 Isaac Asimov wrote a special [article ](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/12/27/35-years-ago-isaac-asimov-was-asked-by-the-star-to-predict-the-world-of-2019-here-is-what-he-wrote.html?fbclid=IwAR38DD85Tume85muGqBTjAuARMas0Ivz4O4qgTF8mgu7ZBZHX4g9TFhTPpA/)for the Toronto Star, wherein he made certain predictions about the future. Specifically about the year 2019 (hey that’s now, now!).  Sadly many of these have not YET happened; we're still waiting on moon mining and the rocketing of trash into the endless expanse of space has not taken place. Though a few months ago Elon Musk did shoot his car at Jupiter, it is a matter of opinion whether that constitutes garbage or not (looking at you Chevrolet Volt).

My personal favorite is, ‘Education will become fun...’  As a teacher, I will leave this one to my students to judge (zip it, Kevin!).   Where I do think Mr. Asimov nailed it, in regards to education, is his idea that , ‘There will be an opportunity finally for every youngster, and indeed, every person, to learn what he or she wants to learn, in his or her own time, at his or her own speed, in his or her own way.’ 

While arguments can be made that the ‘every’ part of this statement still has a way to go - socioeconomic realities, gender issues and access to high-speed Internet notwithstanding - it is true.  With the advent of online learning opportunities from Universities and Colleges, MOOCs(massive open online courses), Khan Academy and Tech Bootcamps, ect...people have the ability to learn whatever they want whenever they want.  

Of that list, Tech Bootcamps are of particular relevance to me, as in Nov 2018 I started Flatiron School's Data Science Program. Now I am no 'youngster' but I am availing myself of this new educational reality because of another of Mr. Asimov insights, that 'intensifying computerization' will fundamentally change the way we work. 

He describes a growing divide between those who embrace and master emerging technologies and those who are left behind. A divide akin to the great migration from the field to the factory that occurred during industrialization some few hundred years ago  (and we all know how that well that turned out for everybody).  Oliver Twist aside, I agree with Asimov in its inevitability. 

'Baring a successful Luddite revolution...' the jobs of the future (his future, our now, remember its 2019), will require a deep understanding of and the ability to work with 'intelligent' machines.  And this doesn't mean being really really good at Instagram, we're talking about deep knowledge of how new technologies work, what they can and can't do, and how to implement and improve them. 

Now Mr. Asimov had a fairly rosy outlook for those who were incapable of making the transition to these Jobs Of The Future (cue theremin music (google it) in the background) where they are supported by grudgingly benevolent governments. I do not share his optimism in this regard.  I know which side of the divide I want to be on. 

And more than that I know which side I want my students to be on.  I have no idea what my personal outcome will be from completing this Bootcamp, I may end up staying in primary education, if I do, I hope I will be able to better equip my students for the future that awaits them. As I, myself hope, am better-prepared to face mine.  

Issac (nope feels wrong)...Mr. Asimov was right about many things regarding 2019, technology is ubiquitous and permeating, education is decentralized and freed from the tyranny of time and location,  and I feel he is also right about who will prosper in this new paradigm. I'm betting on it. Who knows, maybe soon my discarded Ah-ha cd's will take up permanent orbit around Europa, Jupiter's sixth moon. Who needs 'em, I've got Spotify (get it, another industry put out of business by technology...I just wanted to be sure you got it ...Ok, bye...).
